## ðŸ“¥ Dataset

This project loads data directly from the web using:
python
pd.read_csv("https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv ")
In this project, I performed an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of global **COVID-19 trends**, focusing on **Germany, Canada, Brazil, France, and Japan**. The analysis explores key metrics such as total cases, deaths, daily new infections, and vaccination progress over time. 

## Project Objectives

- Analyze the progression of total cases and deaths over time
- Compare daily new cases between countries
- Visualize vaccination rollout progress
- Calculate death rates and identify trends
- Communicate findings through visualizations and insights

## Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** â€“ For data cleaning and manipulation
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** â€“ For data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ For interactive development and reporting

## Dataset Source

The dataset was obtained from:
ðŸ”— [Our World in Data - OWID](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv )

## Project Insights
# Project Insights

## 1. Total Deaths Comparison

**Brazil** had the highest number of total deaths among all selected countries.

## 2. Daily New Cases Trends

**Germany** and **France** experienced multiple waves but managed to control daily case increases effectively.

## 3. Vaccination Rollout

**Germany** and **France** vaccinated their populations faster than **Brazil** and **Japan**, which likely contributed to better outcomes.

## 4. Death Rate Analysis

Despite high case numbers, **Japan** maintained one of the lowest death rates, suggesting effective public health strategies.

## 5. Correlation Between Metrics

There is a strong positive correlation between total cases and total deaths, highlighting the importance of containment measures.
