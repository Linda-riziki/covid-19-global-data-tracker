# Project: COVID-19 Global Data Tracker
## ðŸ“¥ Dataset

This project loads data directly from the web using:
python
pd.read_csv("https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv ")

- Compare daily new cases between countries
- Visualize vaccination rollout progress
- Calculate death rates and identify trends
- Communicate findings through visualizations and insights

## Tools & Libraries Used
